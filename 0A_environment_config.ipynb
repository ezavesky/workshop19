    "With the advances in containerization and environment porting, it's gotten a lot easier to develop and debug from just about anywhere.  This workshop hopes to leverage those gains and will utilize [interactive notebooks](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/why-we-use-jupyter-notebooks.html) to demonstrate utilies and processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starter Deployment (CMLP)\n",
    "Another advantage of web-based development is that you don't need to have a high-power local workstation.  Instead, utilizing a notebook server (or hub) installed within an enterprise, just point to the root, authenticate and you're ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of late March 2019, that's the approach made possible by a notebook server hosted by [CMLP](http://cmlp.web.att.com/) (common machine learning platform).  To utilize a notebook right now, follow these simple steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Head to [CMLP](http://cmlp.web.att.com/)\n",
    "2. On the right side of the menu, click on `Workbench` and then `Jupyter`.  You can also try this [direct link](https://cmlp-portal.prod.sci.att.com/#/pages/jupyter) but it may not work if you haven't logged in before.\n",
    "3. Click on the button \"Launch Jupyter\"\n",
    "4. If you've launched it before, you'll jump right into a new jupyter notebook session, head to the next section called \"Install the Basics\"!\n",
    "5. If you're asked additional questions about creating a new environment, just accept the defaults and proceed.  In the worst case scenario, you will be presented with a loading screen for about 5 minutes while a new node is started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starter Deployment (local Jupyter)\n",
    "If you're starting from scratch on your own machine, there's a little more work to do -- but not much.  This workflow was pruned to just the basic, clear steps to get started.  Luckily, there are some great tutorials by the [Pinnacle](https://pinnacle.web.att.com/learn) project for setting up an approved environment or using [DewDrop VMs](https://wiki.web.att.com/x/y4TpOQ) if you would rather host things locally.  \n",

With these two configurations, you should be able to proceed to using actual scripts to do the hard work.\n",

    "2. Download a source/tar release of the code.  If you can access CodeCloud, it should just be a matter of [this download link](https://codecloud.web.att.com/rest/api/latest/projects/ST_MLHACK19/repos/ml_workshop/archive?format=zip) and then copying the file to your working jupyter environment.\n",
    "\n",
