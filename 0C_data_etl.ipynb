These partitions help us to avoid the problems of over-fitting and under-fitting while training for our problem.  Additionally, by doing the segmentation this early in model building, we'll be able to keep consistent samples for comparing different models that are evaluated.  In the special function `train_test_split` we specify the column `overall` so that we get a set of balanced classes in our training and testing data.\n",

In this boxplot, the circles are sample values, green lines are the mean, and blue error bars show the variance of the mean.  Features that have no error bars indicate that they are mostly sparse."
