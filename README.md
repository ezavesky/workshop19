## How to Use the Notebooks

The format of this workshop is [interactive notebooks](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/why-we-use-jupyter-notebooks.html) executed in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).  This concept is tried and true, since early days of AT&T's internal [RCloud](http://rcloud.social/index.html), and is still a great way to have interactivity in almost any language.

To follow along with the presentation, if a slide mentions "notebook C" look for the file
"0C_xxxxx" where "xxxxx" may indicate other topic specificity.  It should be noted that 
you will need to shutdown notebooks when you're done to release allocated resources, but
otherwise a notebook is a concurrent session that can help to easily develop and debug code.

_Why the '0' prefix?_ We're scientists and researchers, but we can still use tricks from the 
phone book to get our code at the top of a directory list!
